Changelog for SFGUI, http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de/

0.1.0

Enhancements:
  - Implemented SpinButton widget.
  - Optimized primitive construction and label resizing.
  - Linking to dependencies skipped for Linux systems.
  - Removed (too) specific settings regarding the linker (no more linking to
    static runtime libraries and SFML static linking settings).
  - Examples' data directory copied to CMake build cache directory for easier
    testing when developing.
  - SFGUI_ROOT is now the preferred way of given an extra search path when
    looking for SFGUI through find_package(). The old SFGUIDIR is still
    available.

Fixes:
  - Mouse leaving SFML window causing a very very long scroll action with
    scrollbars, resulting in lag.
  - Uninitialized text margin variable in entry widget.
  - Widgets not automatically refreshing when a property is changed after their
    drawables are constructed.
  - Widgets not automatically refreshing when their ID or class is changed.
  - sf::Event::MouseEntered and sf::Event::MouseLeft not being handled
    properly.
